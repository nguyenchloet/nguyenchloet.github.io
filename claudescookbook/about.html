            <p>My grandfather was raised on a farm in Selestat, France.<br>
                He started working in kitchens at age 13 to be sure he had consistent meals.<br>
                Later, he worked in restaurants in Paris, then immigrated to NYC and opened a restaurant called Nicola's.<br>
                After selling the restaurant, my grandparents returned to France to retire and reside there today.<br>
                These are his recipes taken verbatim by pencil and later stored online.<br><br>
                In the future I would like to target the yield and ingredient amounts with JS so the yield can be manipulated and the ingredient amounts will adjust accordingly.<br><br>
