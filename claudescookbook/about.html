                    <p>My grandfather was raised on a farm in the Grand Est, Haut-Rhin region of France. He started working in kitchens at a young age before moving to Paris to learn the trade.
                        Later, he immigrated to New York City and opened a restaurant called Nicola's for decades before retiring back to France.<br><br>
                        My family always try to get recipes from Claude and it has never been easy. His directions usually are frustratingly imprecise such as 'a soup spoon or two', 
                        and if I ask for a specific measurement, he tells me to add 'a good amount'. How do I know if something is ready? 'When it's done' he says. How much salt and pepper should I add? 'To taste!' he says.<br><br>
                        These are his recipes taken verbatim with pencil and paper and slightly edited for clarity.<br><br>
                        <em>Anything marked "Notes" are comments I added to help clarify</em><br><br>
                        <span>Future upgrades: <br>add translation widget</span><br>
                        <span>allow conversions between # / grams</span><br>
                        <span>output fractions instead of decimal value</span>
